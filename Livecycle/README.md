[Livecycle](https://livecycle.io) Livecycle is an inclusive collaboration platform that helps teams 10x the speed of PR reviews so they can ship code faster.

Once Livecycle is installed on the Git repository, an ephemeral "playground" environment is created for every PR and commit, and is accessible with a single click. Each Livecycle playground has built-in annotation tools, so teammates can leave review comments in their full context on top of the product UI. The comments are organized in Livecycle and also synced back to Git so the code owners can understand and resolve the issues quickly and easily. 

According to CTO and co-founder Yshay Yaacobi, open-source project maintenance is one of Livecycle’s most important use cases: “Livecycle, like many other solutions today, is built on top of amazing open-source solutions. Our core product functionality lies on the top of the PR process that was popularized by OSS, and we’re on a mission to make this process more accessible and inclusive to everyone. Livecycle will be **free forever for OSS projects**, as we hope to enable seamless collaboration between maintainers and contributors (including non-technical stakeholders).”

Yshay adds that in an OSS context, this becomes [very powerful](https://livecycle.io/blogs/oss/): “The OSS workflow is distributed and unpredictable by nature, and so the ability to provide instant visibility to a particular code change, and to streamline communication between project maintainers and contributors can really make an impact on the success of the project”.

## Livecycle's OSS activities:

In addition to the benefits of the product itself, Liveycle is also giving back to the OSS community in other ways:

  - **Sponsorship** - They’ve decided as a company to support any open-source project that brings them value day-to-day, (a recent example of this is Chakra UI)
  - **Sponsorship advocacy** - They’ve also taken these efforts one step further and [openly encourage](https://livecycle.io/blogs/why-we-support-open-source-chakra/) other companies to do the same, and “give back” to the creators of the open-source tools that the community is benefiting from.
  - **[The Dev-X Project](https://livecycle.io/devx/)** - Livecycle’s growing DX community features leading developers from across the industry, with an emphasis on highlighting those who believe in the power and the importance of open-source.
