[Nirmata](https://nirmata.com/) is the creator of [Kyverno](https://kyverno.io), the Kubernetes native policy engine OSS. Nirmata’s mission is to make Kubernetes secure and easy to use by addressing the critical needs of DevOps teams. 

Kyverno was created by Nirmata in 2019 and donated to [Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)](https://www.cncf.io/) as a Sandbox project in November 2020. Kyverno provides the ability to secure and automate Kubernetes, using policies written as native Kubernetes resources with no new language to learn. Kyverno policies can validate, mutate, and generate Kubernetes configurations. It has seen rapid adoption from the CNCF community and in July 2022 graduated to CNCF Incubating status. CNCF [graduated and incubating projects](https://www.cncf.io/projects/) are considered stable and used successfully in production.

“Software is transforming the world, and open-source is transforming how software is built and consumed”, says Jim Bugwadia, co-founder and CEO at Nirmata. “Cloud computing is powered by open-source tools like Kubernetes and it's important for us to contribute to and drive the future of these pivotal technologies.”

## Why is Kyverno open-sourced?

When asked why Kyverno was open-sourced, Jim replied, “Kubernetes is not secured by default, and over 80% of security incidents are caused by misconfigurations. Working with early adopters, Nirmata believes that native policies offer the best way to secure and automate Kubenetes, and hence should be available to all users. By growing Kubernetes usage and policy adoption, Nirmata and ecosystem vendors can offer value-added commercial capabilities to organizations that need features for collaboration and integrations. 


Nirmata open-sourced Kyverno and donated it to the CNCF so that it is freely available to the entire Kubernetes community and ecosystem. This allows end users the peace of mind to pick a CNCF backed project that has a large and fast-growing community and is not a single vendor-led project.”

## Nirmata’s contributions to Open-Source

As mentioned, In November 2020 Nirmata donated Kyverno to the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). This means that Nirmata no longer owns the Kyverno project or its trademarks and that Kyverno is now owned and backed by the CNCF which is a part of the Linux Foundation. 

This helps mitigate the risk of using a single vendor controlled OSS project in production for users and also allows other vendors to freely build their own commercial or open source solutions on Kyverno.
 
In addition to making their main product open-source under the CNCF umbrella, Nirmata has a full team of developers who develop and mantain the Kyverno project along with contributors from the CNCF ecosystem and end user community. You can meet the Kyverno team (virtually) in any of their regular [community meetings](https://kyverno.io/community/#community-meetings) where contributors and end users discuss upcoming features and issues. All maintainers and several end-users are also available via the [Kyverno slack channel](https://kyverno.io/community/#slack-channel).

In 2022, Nirmata was also a gold sponsor of several [DevOpsDays](https://devopsdays.org/) events, which openly advocates and provides a stage for Open-Source related talks, and the Nirmata team actively contributes to other OSS communities within the Linux Foundation via presentations and project deliverables in the OSS realm.
