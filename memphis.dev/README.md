# Memphis.dev & Open Source
** image **
[Memphis.dev](https://bit.ly/3z60CML "Memphis.dev") is an open-sourced message broker for developers,<br>built out of the struggles of developers working with alternative solutions like Apache Kafka, RabbitMQ, and others.<br>

:wrench: **The struggles Memphis.dev Broker solves are:**<br>
1. Kafka, RabbitMQ, NATS, and other MQs/MBs are HARD to deploy, manage, secure, update, onboard, and tune.
2. The eventâ€™s journey is hard to debug and troubleshoot.
3. Different and complex schemas (For each data source or service).
4. Transform the data schema and analyze streamed data per source.

[Memphis.dev](https://bit.ly/3z60CML "Memphis.dev") top priority is to enable developers to build data/event-driven apps faster,<br>better, and easier, with an out-of-the-box framework to support developing complex<br>use-cases, such as inline transformations, processing, and tools to troubleshoot both the cluster and the entire path a single event is going through.

:package: **The entire Memphis.dev core is open-sourced** and comprises three main components - Broker, Control-plane, and UI.
- [Broker](https://bit.ly/38TN640 "Broker") - Where data flows between producers and consumers
- [Control-plane](https://bit.ly/3t2HTOu "Control-plane") - The engine behind the Memphis.dev cluster
- [UI](https://bit.ly/3POXhYj "UI") - Graphical User Interface to manage and view Memphis.dev
