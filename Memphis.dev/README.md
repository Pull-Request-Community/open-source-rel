[Memphis.dev](https://memphis.dev "Memphis.dev") is an open-source, modern replacement for Apache Kafka, built out of the struggles of developers working with event-driven architectures, troubleshooting, and scaling. Memphis enables devs to get a fully-optimized message broker and achieve all other message brokers' benefits in a fraction of the time.

When asked what Memphis's future would be in terms of open-source, **Idan Asulin, CTO & Co-Founder**, replied:
> Memphis.dev started as, and always will be an open-source project next to a future managed version. Community-driven product is one of Memphis’ fundamental beliefs to create a value-first solution to real users’ struggles.

According to Idan, the main advantages behind building an open-source first product are - 
- **Community Power** - Community is one of the biggest strengths any product can have. First, feature validation is one of the biggest challenges any PM or developer has. With an engaging community that follows the product's evolutions and core DNA, it is easier to understand if the feature made the right impact and was built correctly. With a community of followers, submitting a poll on the project’s chat platform and reviewing the responses will provide great value. Second, Instead of creating your roadmap based on several minds of your team, share it with your followers and get 10X more ideas that would have a higher chance of solving a real pain.
- **No Vendor-lock** - This one goes both ways. Open core allows customers (both large and small companies) to go inside the implemented system's core and provide much-needed ability to troubleshoot and better tune it based on the environment's needs. 
- **Elasticity** - When built right, open-source is a great way to allow your contributors and community to stretch the project abilities, like creating SDKs, required components, features, UI enhancements if they exist, and more.
- **Easier adoption** - Getting early adopters or adopting an open-source project is much more straightforward than proprietary software. Why? (a) Open-source adoption usually doesn't require a formal commitment of any kind. (b) Support is made by the community and does not require the creator to hire support engineers on day 1. ( c) If appropriately documented, the onboarding process should be self-served and performed autonomously by the users.

Memphis actively contributes to Open-Source in several ways:
- Memphis core components such as UI, Broker, CLI, SDKs are [open-sourced](https://github.com/memphisdev/memphis-broker "open-sourced").
- The architecture of Memphis is entirely pluggable. In the current version, the community can further extend SDKs to include most of the popular languages. 
In the future, a marketplace of connectors and functions will enable even wider extensions and work with Memphis as with building blocks.
- Memphis is also a contributor and an active participant in “Data on Kubernetes” Community, CNCF, and NATS.IO.
